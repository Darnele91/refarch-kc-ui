# User Interface and BFF for the K Container shipment solution

This repository includes the user interface in Angular as Single Page Application and the BFF in nodejs to present the container shipment demonstration. It uses the different simulator microservices and functions to support the end to end demonstration. This project is part of the Container shipment reference implementation as presented in [this project](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc).

You can read the content using the [book view](http://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc-ui).

## Build and Run

The `scripts` folder has two scripts to build the UI, and a docker image for the server and single page app, and run it locally. You should clone all the KC solution repositories and use each component one by one, or use our IBM public cloud deployment. To be able to run the UI locally, you need to have at least the following component up and running:

* Kafka and zookeeper: Use the docker compose file in the root project: 
 ```
 cd ../refarch-kc/docker
 docker-compose -f backbone-compose.yml up
 ```
* Start the Fleet simulator.  For the fleet simulator [see instructions here](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ms/tree/master/fleet-ms#run) to run the simulator locally.

* Make sure you have the angular cli installed via `npm install -g @angular/cli` and run an initial `npm install` inside the ui folder to pull all dependencies.

* Build UI and server and a docker image with the command: `./scripts/build.sh`. The trace looks like:
