It is done with Angular 8 with a Back end for front end server done in Nodejs. This is the only component of the solution that is not using publishing events. You will learn how to do test driven development with Angular, and the BFF pattern in action. This project is part of the Container shipment reference implementation as presented in this project . User stories to support This project is in light development so the following user stories are in plan (or done): [x] As a fleet manager I want to login to the webapp to access the fleet management feature. Use eddie@email.com. [x] As a fleet manager I want to select one of the fleet to get the list of ships with their attributes in a table format, and plot the ship on a map at their respective position (latitude, longitude) [x] As a demoer I want to start ship movement so the ships move on the map [x] As a fleet manager I want to select one ship from the table of ships and present a detail view of it with its containers loaded in the boat [x] As a demoer I want to start the fire to container or heat wave or container down simulation from the detailed ship view [ ] As a demoer I want to see the message coming back from the streaming analytics about next best action from my simulation UI Development This is a traditional Angular 7 app with the app.module.ts using shared and features modules. Shared is for UI generic widgets, while features are for supporting the UI specific components linked to the business logic. There is no login page yet, but the home page displays a set of tiles to support the demonstration of the full shipment process as illustrated in the figure below: For the BFF code the server code is under the server folder and uses the standard patterns for expressjs middleware. The readme file goes into the details on this implementation. This project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.1. The user interface features are under the features folder. We are using a TDD approach as described in this note. The tests run with ng test . We also encourage to read the angular.io testing guide Contribute As this implementation solution is part of the Event Driven architeture reference architecture, the contribution policies apply the same way here.

The UI is using Angular so you need to get angular CLI installed, nodejs and npm. Keep npm up to date with the command: npm install -g npm Verify node version (we run v 12.0) node -v To install or update Angular CLI cd ui npm install -g @angular/cli And install all the dependencies npm install Note The project was started with Angular 6 and then migrated to Angular 8 with the commands: ng update @angular/cli @angular/core ng update @angular/material The test driven development approach is done using mocha as test runner and chai for assertion library and Typescript. Which means those tools were installed with the command: $ npm install mocha chai ts-node --save-dev # and install the supporting types for Typescript # npm install @types/chai @types/mocha --save-dev Build UI Build While doing development, you can build the UI first, by being under the ui folder and run: ng build You should get a trace like: chunk {main} main-es2015.js, main-es2015.js.map (main) 156 kB [initial] [rendered] chunk {polyfills} polyfills-es2015.js, polyfills-es2015.js.map (polyfills) 438 kB [initial] [rendered] chunk {runtime} runtime-es2015.js, runtime-es2015.js.map (runtime) 6.08 kB [entry] [rendered] chunk {styles} styles-es2015.js, styles-es2015.js.map (styles) 392 kB [initial] [rendered] chunk {vendor} vendor-es2015.js, vendor-es2015.js.map (vendor) 5.81 MB [initial] [rendered] The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build so the javascripts will be smaller. It is possible to test the User interface without the nodejs backend, by using ng serve Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the UI source files. You may encounter some issues as there are dependencies on the backend nodejs for some APIs and data. UI Running unit tests Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma . Build and run the BFF server Run the command below: npm serve All those commands are executed when developing the server or ui parts. But when we need to deploy the user interface with the other components of the solution we first need to build a docker image and then be sure the other services are deployed... Dockerize all Build UI and server in one command: (this is what a CI/CD pipeline will use). ./scripts/buildDocker.sh This will build a docker image, named: ibmcase/kc-ui:latest for local execution using docker-compose. If you run on minikube locally use: ./scripts/buildDocker.sh MINIKUBE Run locally To be able to run the UI and server locally, you need to have at least the following kafka, zookeeper, order command, order query and fleet simulator microservices up and running. As introduced before we have two options to run the solution, Minikube or docker-compose. Using docker compose We recommend to read this chapter If not done already start Kafka and zookeeper using the docker compose file in the root project: cd ../refarch-kc/docker docker-compose -f backbone-compose.yml up Start the Fleet simulator. For the fleet simulator see instructions here to run the simulator locally. Start the UI and BFF locally with ./script/run.sh or with a docker ./script/runDocker.sh . Use your web browser at http://localhost:31010 Using Minikube See the instruction in this article for deploying all the components. Use the scripts\\deployHelm MINIKUBE latest command to use Helm to deploy the user interface release.
